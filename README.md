# SQL Server and Power BI Integration Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence (BI) solution for analyzing internet sales data from the **AdventureWorks 2022** database. The workflow involves data extraction and transformation using SQL Server, followed by data visualization and analysis in Power BI.

---

### Technologies Used

- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI
- **Sample Data:** AdventureWorks 2022

---

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The analysis is structured around two main dashboards: a **General** dashboard for high-level business metrics and a **Customers** dashboard for a more segmented view of the sales data.

**General Dashboard**
- Total Revenue
- Quantity Sold
- Profit by Country
- Total Product Categories
- Profit Margin
- Revenue and Profit by Month
- Quantity Sold by Month

**Customers Dashboard**
- Sales by Country
- Customers by Country
- Sales by Gender
- Sales by Category

---

### Project Process

1. **Environment Setup:** The project begins with downloading and configuring the **AdventureWorks 2022** sample database in SQL Server.
2. **Data Modeling:** Instead of importing multiple tables into Power BI, a SQL `VIEW` (`RESULTS_ADW`) was created in SQL Server to centralize the business logic. This approach ensures better performance and a single source of truth for the data.
3. **Data Transformation:** The `VIEW` performs all necessary joins and creates new columns (like `Sales Profit`) directly in the database.
4. **Data Visualization:** The `VIEW` is then connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for sales analysis.

---

### Database Schema and SQL Code

The following tables and columns were used to build the final `VIEW`.

- `FactInternetSales`: Sales details.
- `DimCustomer`: Customer information.
- `DimProductCategory`: Product categories.
- `DimGeography`: Customer location.

**SQL View for Analysis**

The `RESULTS_ADW` view provides a clean, ready-to-use dataset for Power BI.

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW RESULTS_ADW AS
SELECT
    fis.SalesOrderNumber AS 'Order No.',
    DATEADD(YEAR, 9, fis.OrderDate) AS 'Order Date',
    dpc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS 'Product Category',
    fis.CustomerKey AS 'Customer ID',
    dc.FirstName + ' ' + dc.LastName AS 'Customer Name',
    REPLACE(REPLACE(dc.Gender, 'M', 'Male'), 'F', 'Female') AS 'Gender',
    dg.EnglishCountryRegionName AS 'Country',
    fis.OrderQuantity AS 'Quantity Sold',
    fis.SalesAmount AS 'Sales Revenue',
    fis.TotalProductCost AS 'Sales Cost',
    fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost AS 'Sales Profit'
FROM FactInternetSales fis
INNER JOIN DimProduct dp ON fis.ProductKey = dp.ProductKey
    INNER JOIN DimProductSubcategory dps ON dp.ProductSubcategoryKey = dps.ProductSubcategoryKey
        INNER JOIN DimProductCategory dpc ON dps.ProductCategoryKey = dpc.ProductCategoryKey
INNER JOIN DimCustomer dc ON fis.CustomerKey = dc.CustomerKey
    INNER JOIN DimGeography dg ON dc.GeographyKey = dg.GeographyKey
```

### Additional Analysis: Focusing on 2021 Sales

For a more specific case study, a second view, `ONLINE_SALES`, was created to analyze only the sales from the year **2021**.

**SQL View for 2021 Sales (`ONLINE_SALES`)**

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW ONLINE_SALE AS
SELECT
    fis.SalesOrderNumber AS 'Order No.',
    CAST(DATEADD(YEAR, 9, fis.OrderDate) AS DATE) AS 'Order Date',
    dpc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS 'Product Category',
    dc.FirstName + ' ' + dc.LastName AS 'Customer Name',
    dst.SalesTerritoryCountry AS 'Country',
    fis.OrderQuantity AS 'Quantity Sold',
    fis.TotalProductCost AS 'Sales Cost',
    fis.SalesAmount AS 'Sales Revenue'
FROM FactInternetSales fis
INNER JOIN DimProduct dp ON fis.ProductKey = dp.ProductKey
    INNER JOIN DimProductSubcategory dps ON dp.ProductSubcategoryKey = dps.ProductSubcategoryKey
        INNER JOIN DimProductCategory dpc ON dps.ProductCategoryKey = dpc.ProductCategoryKey
INNER JOIN DimCustomer dc ON fis.CustomerKey = dc.CustomerKey
INNER JOIN DimSalesTerritory dst ON fis.SalesTerritoryKey = dst.SalesTerritoryKey
WHERE YEAR(CAST(DATEADD(YEAR, 9, fis.OrderDate) AS DATE)) = 2021
```

### Data Optimization and Update Example

This section shows how to maintain data consistency by simulating a data update using a SQL transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION T1
    
    UPDATE FactInternetSales
    SET OrderQuantity = 20
    WHERE ProductKey = 361     -- Category Bike
    
COMMIT TRANSACTION T1
```
### üìä Power BI Dashboard Construction  

After creating the SQL views (`RESULTS_ADW` and `ONLINE_SALES`) in SQL Server, the next step was to connect **Power BI Desktop** to the database to visualize and analyze the processed data.  

Using the **‚ÄúGet Data ‚Üí SQL Server‚Äù** option, the connection was established by entering the server and database names (**AdventureWorks2022**). In the Navigator window, both views were selected and imported into Power BI. Since the SQL views already contained all the necessary joins and transformations, the data model in Power BI was **flat and optimized**, requiring minimal modeling effort.  

For enhanced time-based analysis, a **Date Dimension table** was added to enable filtering by **year, month, and day**.

### üß© Dashboard Design  

The Power BI report was designed with **two main dashboards**, following the defined KPIs for sales performance and customer insights.  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ General Sales Dashboard**  
Focuses on the overall business performance with the following visuals:  
- **Cards:** Total Revenue, Quantity Sold, Number of Customers, Profit Margin  
- **Line Chart:** Revenue and Profit by Month  
- **Bar Chart:** Quantity Sold by Month  
- **Choropleth Map:** Profit by Country  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Customers Dashboard**  
Provides a deeper analysis of customer profiles and sales segmentation:  
- **Choropleth Maps:** Sales by Country, Customers by Country  
- **Bar/Funnel Chart:** Sales by Category  
- **Donut/Stacked Column Chart:** Sales by Gender  

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Interactivity and Functionality  

The dashboard is fully **interactive**, allowing users to explore data dynamically:  
- Selecting a country on the map automatically updates all other visuals (KPIs, charts, and trends).  
- Filters and slicers enable users to focus on specific periods, categories, or customer groups.  
- The navigation between dashboards provides both a **strategic overview** and a **detailed breakdown** of sales insights.
